# Building a Dashboard

Dashboards allow you to place multiple tables or graphs on one page, so that you can get a view of related content. By organizing visualizations onto Dashboards, you can combine tables and charts in useful and interesting layouts.  
  
To create a Dashboard;

1. Click on the **+** sign button at the top right corner of the screen in Metrics. There are two options listed in the menu. 
2. Click on **New Dashboard** and enter a name for the Dashboard.
3. A new blank Dashboard page opens.

### Tiles 

{% hint style="info" %}
Each element in a Dashboard is called a **tile**. 
{% endhint %}

There are three types of tiles:

#### Look-linked tiles

You can add previously saved Looks to Dashboards. These tiles are linked to a Look and if the Look is changed, the changes on the Look will be reflected in the Dashboard as well. The Look and the Dashboard must be in the same Space. If the Look is deleted, the Dashboard will show an error for this tile. A Look-linked tile is a good choice if you want to create, change, and test a query in one place but use it in multiple Dashboards.

#### Query tiles

You can create a Look from scratch and save it as a query tile in the Dashboard. These tiles aren't linked to anywhere and changes are only reflected within the Dashboard. You can also convert a Look-linked tile into a query tile \(_via the gear icon at the top in the Look page_\) to break the connection, so that the tile is unaffected by any later changes to that Look. The query tile will still exist independently on the Dashboard even if the Look is deleted.

#### Text tiles

You can use text tiles to add headers and text to your Dashboards. Text tiles can be used to make visual sections on a Dashboard or add descriptions as needed.

### Adding Tiles to the Dashboard

To add a tile to a new Dashboard;

1. Click on **Edit** on the top right corner of the screen. This enables Edit mode for the whole dashboard. 
2. Three options are listed at the top of the page and you can click on the names to add the corresponding tiles. **New Tile** adds a query tile, **Looks** adds a Look-linked tile and **Text** adds a text tile.

Text tiles are useful to add headers and text to your Dashboards for splitting up information or providing descriptions where needed.
